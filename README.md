# Customer Sales Analysis

## Project Objectives
This project aims to analyze sales data to understand customer purchasing behavior, product category revenue, and sales trends. The insights support informed business decisions in marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement.

## Dataset

## Key Analysis Steps
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using Python (Jupyter Notebook `eda_analysis.ipynb`).  
- Analytical SQL queries to calculate key metrics such as purchase frequency, total revenue by client and time, and customer ranking.  
- Visualization of results in Python and creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI.  
- Preparation of a presentation summarizing findings and recommendations (`Customer_Sales_Analysis.pdf`).

## Presentation Summary
The presentation highlights the main analysis results, including identified patterns, customer segments, and recommendations for sales optimization. Viewing the slides is recommended for deeper insights.
