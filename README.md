# Customer Sales Analysis

## Project Objectives
This project analyzes sales data to understand customer purchasing behavior, product category revenue, and sales trends. Insights support informed business decisions in marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement.

- Analytical SQL queries calculating metrics like purchase frequency, total revenue by client and time, and customer ranking.
- Visualization of results in Python and creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
- Preparation of presentation summarizing findings and recommendations (`Customer_Sales_Analysis.pdf`).
